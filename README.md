# Snake
Just a fun little Snake game in Python

It turns out that the curses python module doesn't have an official windows port yet.
This needs to be ported to a Linux system to work. (Or use one of the unnoficial windows curse modules)
dos2Unix does the trick with the ^M issue you get going from Windows to Linux, but it also upsets Python's indentation rules.
